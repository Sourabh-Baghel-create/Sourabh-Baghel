# C++ Beginner Projects

Hi, I'm Sourabh Baghel. This repository contains some small C++ projects I completed during my internship and early learning phase.

### Included Projects:
- Number Guessing Game
- Simple Calculator
- To-Do List

### Note:
These are beginner-level programs written during my first few weeks of learning C++. They are not optimized or polished, and may contain basic mistakes.

I'm sharing them here as part of my learning journey, not as professional-level code.

### Started Learning: June 2025

I plan to improve these and add better versions as I gain experience.
